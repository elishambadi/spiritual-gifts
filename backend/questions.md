SPIRITUAL GIFTS SURVEY
DIRECTIONS
This is not a test, so there are no wrong answers. The Spiritual Gifts Survey consists of 80
statements. Some items reflect concrete actions; other items are descriptive traits; and still
others are statements of belief.

• Select the one response you feel best characterizes yourself and place that number in
the blank provided. Record your answer in the blank beside each item.
• Do not spend too much time on any one item. Remember, it is not a test. Usually your
immediate response is best.
• Please give an answer for each item. Do not skip any items.
• Do not ask others how they are answering or how they think you should answer.
• Work at your own pace.

Your response choices are:
5—Highly characteristic of me/definitely true for me
4—Most of the time this would describe me/be true for me
3—Frequently characteristic of me/true for me–about 50 percent of the time
2—Occasionally characteristic of me/true for me–about 25 percent of the time

that gift.
2. For each gift shade the bar below the mark that you have drawn.
3. The resultant graph gives a picture of your gifts. Gifts for which the bars are tall are the ones
in which you appear to be strongest. Gifts for which the bars are very short are the ones in
which you appear not to be strong.


Now that you have completed the survey, thoughtfully answer the following questions.
The gifts I have begun to discover in my life are:

2. ___________________________________________
3. ___________________________________________

• After prayer and worship, I am beginning to sense that God wants me to use my spiritual

Ask God to help you know how He has gifted you for service and how you can begin to use this
gift in ministry to others.
